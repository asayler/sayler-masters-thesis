\section{Architecture}

\begin{packed_item}
\item A back-end key:value store for mapping encrypted data set
  identifiers (e.g. via UUIDs) to the corresponding encryption key for
  said data set.
\item A standardized front-end API and message exchange format
  promoting the creation and proliferation of multiple implementations
  across a selection of providers.
\item A flexible and programable key access control system, supporting
  an extensible variety of authentication attributes and the ability
  to craft access control rules from attributes.
\item An auditing system for monitoring and recording
  encryption key access data.
\item A notion of per-provider logical centralization and public
  accessibility to ensure service can be accessed from a range of
  locations.
