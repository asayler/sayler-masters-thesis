\subsection*{Abstract}

The magnitude of the digital data we create, store, and interact with
on a daily basis is rapidly increasing. Simultaneously, we are
demanding increasingly diverse use cases for our data: from spreading
it across a variety of services and devices to sharing it with a
number of organizations and friends. Securing our data and controlling
who can access it is thus increasingly important, but also
increasingly difficult. The primary tools we have for protecting our
data, strong encryption systems, are extremely inflexible. This
inflexibility is due to encryption key storage being too tightly
coupled with existing data encryption solutions. This tight coupling
makes these systems unusable for many of our desired use cases,
leading to the underutilization of strong encryption and the
associated lack of protection and control of our data. We believe that
this issue can be solved by providing a ``Key Storage as a Service''
system that separates secure key storage and access control from the
underling encryption mechanisms. Toward this end, we present Custos: a
flexible Cloud-based key storage and access control service.
