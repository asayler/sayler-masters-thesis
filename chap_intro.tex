\section{Overview}

\subsection{Separating Functionality from Trust}

Discuss separating what we use from who we trust. E.g. ``Using
facebook'' vs ``trusting Facebook''

\subsection{Key Storage as a Service}

Discuss separating key storage from encryption.

<UUID> : <Data Encryption Key>

\subsection{Flexibility and Usability}

Discuss need for variable levels of trust and flexible methods of
authentication. Discuss fitting security to desired uses. Avoiding
``one size fits all'' mentality.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Encryption}

Discuss symmetric and asymmetric encryption, uses, strengths,
weaknesses, etc.

Encryption = solved problem

Key Storage = The real challenge

\subsection{Secure Storage}

Discuss existing approaches (full stack systems, layered systems),
strengths, weaknesses, etc

\subsection{Human Factors}

Disuses existing usability challenges

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Authentication Systems}

PAM, Shibboleth, OAuth, OpenID, SAML, Etc

\subsection{File Systems}

eCryptFS, LUKS, Oceanstore, Tahoe, AFS, Etc

\subsection{Other Systems}

Anything else?
